# Fast Image Viewer

FIV is a Windows standalone program created in C# using WPF, and uses Inno Setup for installing.

It improves significantly over the default Windows 7, 8, and 10 Image Viewers, supporting more types like .gif and .ico, capability
to pause gifs, shortcuts to various useful functions, a folder view for ease of access to all images, and more!


# Supports Localization

While incomplete, the app supports some localization with the ability to add more and improve upon the current ones with each update.


# Libraries

FIV uses libraries like MahApps to improve both visuality and functionality, Fody to reduce files count, Toast notifications, and Gu localization to support multiple languages.
