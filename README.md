# About

Fast Image Viewer (FIV) is a Windows standalone program created in C# using WPF, and uses Inno Setup for installation.

It improves significantly over the default Windows 7, 8, and 10 Image Viewers, supporting more types like .gif and .ico, capability
to pause animated images, shortcuts to various useful functions, a folder view for ease of access to all images, and more!


# Supports Localization

While incomplete, the app supports some localization with the ability to add more and improve upon the current ones with each update.
